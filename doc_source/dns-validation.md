# Option 1: DNS validation<a name="dns-validation"></a>

The Domain Name System \(DNS\) is a directory service for resources connected to a network\. Your DNS provider maintains a database containing records that define your domain\. When you choose DNS validation, ACM provides you with one or more CNAME records that must be added to this database\. These records contain a unique key\-value pair that serves as proof that you control the domain\.

For example, if you request a certificate for the `example.com` domain with `www.example.com` as an additional name, ACM creates two CNAME records for you\. Each record, created specifically for your domain and your account, contains a name and a value\. The value is an alias that points to an AWS domain that ACM uses to automatically renew your certificate\. The CNAME records must be added to your DNS database only once\. ACM automatically renews your certificate as long as the certificate is in use and your CNAME record remains in place\. 

**Important**  
If you do not use Amazon Route 53 to manage your public DNS records, contact your DNS provider to find out how to add records\. If you lack authority to edit your domain's DNS database, you must use [email validation](email-validation.md) instead\.

Without the need to repeat validation, you can request additional ACM certificates for your fully qualified domain name \(FQDN\) for as long as the CNAME record remains in place\. That is, you can create replacement certificates that have the same domain name, or certificates that cover different subdomains\. Since the CNAME validation token works for any region, you can re\-create the same certificate in multiple regions\. You can also replace a deleted certificate\. 

You can stop automatic renewal either by removing the certificate from the AWS service with which it is associated or by deleting the CNAME record\. If Route 53 is not your DNS provider, contact your provider to find out how to delete a record\. If Route 53 is your provider, see [Deleting Resource Record Sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-deleting.html) in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*\. For more information about managed certificate renewal, see [Managed renewal for ACM certificates](managed-renewal.md)\. 

**Note**  
CNAME resolution will fail if more than five CNAMEs are chained together in your DNS configuration\. If you require a longer chaining, we recommend using [email validation](email-validation.md)\.

## How CNAME records for ACM work<a name="cnames-overview"></a>

**Note**  
This section is for customers who do not use Route 53 as their DNS provider\.

If you are not using Route 53 as your DNS provider, you need to manually enter CNAME records provided by ACM into your provider's database, usually through a website\. CNAME records are used for a number of purposes, including as redirect mechanisms and as containers for vendor\-specific metadata\. For ACM, these records allow initial domain ownership validation and ongoing automated certificate renewal\. 

The following table shows example CNAME records for six domain names\. Each record's **Record Name**\-**Record Value** pair serves to authenticate domain name ownership\. The *x* values following the underscore \( \_ \) are long random strings generated by ACM\. For example, 

```
_3639ac514e785e898d2646601fa951d5.example.com
```

is representative of a resulting generated **Record Name**\. The associated **Record Value** might be

```
_98d2646601fa951d53639ac514e785e8.acm-validation.aws.
```

for the same record\.

In the table, note that the first two **Record Name**\-**Record Value** pairs are the same\. This illustrates that for a wild\-card domain, such as `*.example.com`, the random strings created by ACM are the same as those created its base domain, `example.com`\. Otherwise, the paired **Record Name** and **Record Value** differ for each domain name\.


**Example CNAME records**  
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html)

**Note**  
If your DNS provider does not support CNAME values with a leading underscore, see [Troubleshoot DNS Validation Problems](troubleshooting-DNS-validation.md)\.

When you request a certificate and specify DNS validation, ACM provides CNAME information in the following format:


****  

| Domain Name | Record Name | Record Type | Record Value | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| example\.com | \_a79865eb4cd1a6ab990a45779b4e0b96\.example\.com\. | CNAME |  \_424c7224e9b0146f9a8808af955727d0\.hkmpvcwbzw\.acm\-validations\.aws\.  | 

*Domain Name* is the FQDN associated with the certificate\. *Record Name* identifies the record uniquely, serving as the key of the key\-value pair\. *Record Value* serves as the value of the key\-value pair\. 

All three of these values must be entered into the appropriates fields of your DNS provider's web interface for adding DNS records\. Providers are inconsistent in their handling of the record name \(or just "name"\) field\. In some cases, you are expected to provide the entire string as shown above\. Other providers automatically append the domain name to whatever string your enter, meaning \(in this example\) that you should only enter

```
_a79865eb4cd1a6ab990a45779b4e0b96
```

into the name field\. If you guess wrong about this, and enter a record name that contains a domain name \(such as *`.example.com`*\), you might end up with a following:

```
_a79865eb4cd1a6ab990a45779b4e0b96.example.com.example.com
```

Validation will fail in this case\. Consequently, you should try to determine in advance which type of input your provider expects\.

## Setting up DNS validation<a name="setting-up-dns-validation"></a><a name="dns-validation-console"></a>

# To set up DNS validation in the console:<a name="dns-validation-console"></a>

1. Sign into the AWS Management Console and open the ACM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/acm/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home)\. If the introductory page appears, choose **Get Started**\. Otherwise, choose **Request a certificate**\. 

1. On the **Request a certificate** page, type your domain name\. For more information about typing domain names, see [Requesting a public certificate](gs-acm-request-public.md)\.

1. To add more domain names to the ACM certificate, type other names as text boxes open beneath the name you just typed\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. Choose **DNS validation** and **Next**\.

1. On the **Add tags** page, you can optionally tag your certificate with metadata\. Choose **Review** when done\.

1. On the **Review** page, verify that domain name and validation method are correct and choose **Confirm and request**\.

1. On the **Validation** page, complete one of the following two procedures:

   1. \(Optional\) Validate with Route 53\.

      On the **Validation** page, click the down\-arrow next to your domain name\. An active **Create record in Route 53** button appears if the following conditions are true:
      + You use Route 53 as your DNS provider\.
      + You have permission to write to the zone hosted by Route 53\.
      + Your FQDN has *not* already been validated\.
**Note**  
If you are in fact using Route 53 but the **Create record in Route 53** button is missing or disabled, see [ACM Console does not display "Create record in Route 53" button](troubleshooting-DNS-validation.md#troubleshooting-route53-1)\. 

      Choose the **Create record in Route 53** button, then choose **Create**\. The **Validation** page now should display a status notification of **Success** at the bottom\. 

      Choose **Continue** to view the **Certificates** list page, where your new certificate may still display a status of **Pending validation** for up to 30 minutes\.
**Tip**  
You cannot programmatically request that ACM automatically create your record in Route 53\. You can, however, make a AWS CLI or API call to Route 53 to create the record in the Route 53 DNS database\. For more information about Route 53 record sets, see [Working with Resource Record Sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/rrsets-working-with.html)\.

   1. \(Optional\) If you are not using Route 53 as your DNS provider, you must retrieve the name of the CNAME information from the **Validation** page and add it your DNS database\. You can do this in either of two ways:
      + In the **Domain** section, expand your domain information and record the CNAME components\. This information needs to be added manually to your DNS database\.
      + Alternatively, choose **Export DNS configuration to a file** at the bottom of the **Validation** page\. The information in the file needs to be added manually to your DNS database\.
**Important**  
To avoid validation problems, review [How CNAME records for ACM work](#cnames-overview) before you add information to your DNS provider's database\. If you do encounter problems, see [Troubleshoot DNS validation problems](troubleshooting-DNS-validation.md)\. 

      After adding the CNAME on your DNS provider's configuration page, return to the ACM console, if it is still open, and choose **Continue**\. If you have already closed the console, you can return to it later to check the status of your certificate request\.

      The **Certificates** page displays a table view that includes all of your certificates\. After your DNS provider propagates your record update, it can take several hours for ACM to validate the domain name and issue the certificate\. During this time, ACM shows the validation status as **Pending validation**\. After validating the domain name, ACM changes the validation status to **Success**\. After AWS issues the certificate, ACM changes the certificate status to **Issued**\. 
**Note**  
If ACM is not able to validate the domain name within 72 hours from the time it generates a CNAME value for you, ACM changes the certificate status to **Validation timed out**\. The most likely reason for this result is that you did not successfully update your DNS configuration with the value that ACM generated\. To remedy this issue, you must request a new certificate after reviewing the CNAME instructions\.
