# What Is AWS CloudHSM?<a name="introduction"></a>

AWS CloudHSM provides hardware security modules in the AWS Cloud\. A hardware security module \(HSM\) is a computing device that processes cryptographic operations and provides secure storage for cryptographic keys\.

When you use an HSM from AWS CloudHSM, you can perform a variety of cryptographic tasks:

+ Generate, store, import, export, and manage cryptographic keys, including symmetric keys and asymmetric key pairs\.

+ Use symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to encrypt and decrypt data\.

+ Use cryptographic hash functions to compute message digests and hash\-based message authentication codes \(HMACs\)\.

+ Cryptographically sign data \(including code signing\) and verify signatures\.

+ Generate cryptographically secure random data\.

If you want a managed service for creating and controlling your encryption keys, but you don't want or need to operate your own HSM, consider using [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)\. 

To learn more about what you can do with AWS CloudHSM, see the following topics\. When you are ready to get started with AWS CloudHSM, see [Getting Started](getting-started.md)\.
